# conceptTreesCharBased


This program creates matrices for character-based concept trees described in chapter 4.2 in Köllner (2021).

In addition, the computation of the maximum likelihood trees using the IQ-Tree software by Nguyen et al (2014), which is online available under: http://www.iqtree.org
